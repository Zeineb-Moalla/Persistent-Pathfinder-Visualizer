 
# 🧭 Persistent Pathfinder Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visual tool for exploring Dijkstra’s algorithm on a 2D grid. I created it as a way to better understand pathfinding algorithms in real-time, and to incorporate ideas like versioning and UI interaction using `pygame`.

You can place start/end points, draw obstacles, and visualize the shortest path; with support for undo/redo actions at every stage. It’s an interactive way to see how graph traversal algorithms work under the hood.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Interactive grid builder with mouse clicks
- Real-time pathfinding using **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- Fully functional **undo/redo** mechanism for all user actions
- Clear visual feedback with color-coded tiles
- Simple UI using `pygame` —> no external frameworks needed

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As part of a graduate-level course on advanced data structures, I wanted to implement a practical system that blends classical algorithmic concepts (like Dijkstra's) with ideas like **persistence** (i.e., state-saving). This app is the result: a small sandbox where algorithm logic meets user interaction.

### 1. Install Python and `pygame`

On top of that, the app supports **persistent undo/redo** by saving a full snapshot of the grid after every meaningful change (start, destination, obstacle, or path). This is implemented in the `VersionManager.py` class.

 ## 💬 Final Thoughts

 I built this tool to help myself (and others) better understand pathfinding and persistence. It could definitely be extended; for example, to support A* search, weighted cells, or even real-time multiplayer editing. But as it stands, I’m proud of it as a functional and educational demo app.
