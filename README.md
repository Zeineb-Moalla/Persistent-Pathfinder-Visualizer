 
# 🧭 Persistent Pathfinder Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visual tool for exploring Dijkstra’s algorithm on a 2D grid. I created it as a way to better understand pathfinding algorithms in real-time, and to incorporate ideas like versioning and UI interaction using `pygame`.

You can place start/end points, draw obstacles, and visualize the shortest path — with support for undo/redo actions at every stage. It’s an interactive way to see how graph traversal algorithms work under the hood.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As part of a graduate-level course on advanced data structures, I wanted to implement a practical system that blends classical algorithmic concepts (like Dijkstra's) with ideas like **persistence** (i.e., state-saving). This app is the result: a small sandbox where algorithm logic meets user interaction.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

The core of the application is built around **Dijkstra’s algorithm**, a classical shortest path algorithm that guarantees an optimal path in graphs with non-negative weights.

Each cell in the grid is treated as a node. If the cell is not an obstacle, it's connected to its neighbors (up/down/left/right) with uniform weight = 1. The algorithm uses a custom **priority queue (min-heap)** to always expand the cheapest unexplored node.

On top of that, the app supports **persistent undo/redo** by saving a full snapshot of the grid after every meaningful change (start, destination, obstacle, or path). This is implemented in the `VersionManager.py` class.
